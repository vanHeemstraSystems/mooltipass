# 100 - Use Multipass with a Website that is not in the Multipass database

This scenario assumes the website (here: Linkwarden) is not in the Multipass database. It also assumes you already have an account with the website.

**NOTE**: Make sure there is a memory card slotted into the Multipass for storing the credentials.

On the computer:

- Enter your credentials on the login page of the website (here: https://cloud.linkwarden.app/login ).

- Click **Login**.
- A notification will alert you that a new credential is detected and that you can add it to Multipass.

On the Multipass:

- The Multipass will prompt:
  ```
  linkwarden.app
  Add New Credentials
  wvanheemstra@icloud.com
  ```
- Press the wheel to accept adding the new credential.
