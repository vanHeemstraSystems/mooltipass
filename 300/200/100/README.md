# 100 - Use Multipass with a Website that is not in the Multipass database

This scenario assumes the website (here: Linkwarden) is not in the Multipass database.

**NOTE**: Make sure there is a memory card slotted into the Multipass for storing the credentials.

On the computer:

- Enter your credentials on the login page of the website (here: https://cloud.linkwarden.app/login ).
