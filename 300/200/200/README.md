# 200 - Use Multipass with a Website that is in the Multipass database

This scenario assumes the website (here: Linkwarden) is in the Multipass database. It also assumes you already have an account with the website.

**NOTE**: Make sure there is a memory card slotted into the Multipass for storing the credentials.

On the computer:

- Visit the login page of the website (here: https://cloud.linkwarden.app/login). **NOTE**: You do **not** have to enter the credentials at this moment.

On the Multipass:

- The Multipass will prompt:
  ```
  linkwarden.app
  Send Credentials For
  wvanheemstra@icloud.com
  ```
- Press the wheel to send the credentials to the login page.

On the computer:

- The credentials will have been sent by the Multipass to the login page, and you are automatically logged in!
